				<h2 class="sectionTitle">What are PFAS?</h2>
			</header>

			Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is a public health concern that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) National Center for Environmental Health (NCEH) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) are helping our local, territorial, tribal, state, and federal partners address. Over the last decade, interest in PFAS has been growing. ATSDR and our state health partners are investigating exposure to and possible health effects associated with PFAS in more than 30 communities across the United States.
			PFAS are man-made chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1950s. They have been used in non-stick cookware, water-repellent clothing, stain resistant fabrics and carpets, some cosmetics, some firefighting foams, and products that resist grease, water, and oil.
			The most commonly studied PFAS are perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS). The next most commonly studied are perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA).  PFOA and PFOS have been phased out of production and use in the United States, but other countries may still manufacture and use them.
			<br><br>
			During production and use, PFAS can migrate into the soil, water, and air. Most PFAS (including PFOA and PFOS) do not breakdown, so they remain in the environment. Because of their widespread use and their persistence in the environment, PFAS are found in the blood of people and animals all over the world and are present at low levels in a variety of food products and in the environment. Some PFAS can build up in people and animals with repeated exposure over time.
			Many scientific articles have been published about PFAS exposure and health effects. While it is difficult to show that substances directly cause health conditions in humans, scientific studies have shown that exposure to some PFAS in the environment may be linked to harmful health effects in humans and animals. More research is needed to better understand the health effects of PFAS exposure.
			New kinds of PFAS are being developed. Some of these may have properties similar to the existing PFAS, and some may be less persistent in the environment. There are very few scientific studies on new PFAS, so more research is necessary to discover whether they may be a health concern.

				<h2 class="sectionTitle">How can I be exposed to PFAS?</h2>
			</header>


			You can be exposed to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by

		    Drinking contaminated municipal water or private well water
		    Eating fish caught from water contaminated by PFAS (PFOS, in particular)
		    Accidentally swallowing contaminated soil or dust
		    Eating food that was packaged in material that contains PFAS
		    Using some consumer products such as non-stick cookware, stain resistant carpeting, and water repellant clothing.

			Research has suggested that exposure to PFOA and PFOS from today’s consumer products is usually low, especially when compared to exposures to contaminated drinking water. Some products that may contain PFAS include:

		    Some grease-resistant paper, fast food containers/wrappers, microwave popcorn bags, pizza boxes, and candy wrappers
		    Nonstick cookware
		    Stain resistant coatings used on carpets, upholstery, and other fabrics
		    Water resistant clothing
		    Cleaning products
		    Personal care products (shampoo, dental floss) and cosmetics (nail polish, eye makeup)
		    Paints, varnishes, and sealants
			<br><br>
			Babies born to mothers exposed to PFAS can be exposed during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. However, nursing mothers should continue to breastfeed.

		    Breastfeeding is good for the health of both infants and mothers. Some of the many benefits include immune system advantages, lower obesity rates, and greater cognitive development for the infant.
		    The American Academy of Pediatrics states that “even though a number of environmental pollutants readily pass to the infant through human milk, the advantages of breastfeeding continue to greatly outweigh the potential risks in nearly every circumstance.” (American Academy of Pediatrics, Council on Environmental Health. Breast Milk. In: Etzel, RA, ed. Pediatric Environmental Health, 3rd ed. Elk Grove Village IL:American Academy of Pediatrics; 2012. P. 199.)
		    Scientists continue to do research in this area. Based on current science, the benefits of breastfeeding appear to outweigh the risks for infants exposed to PFAS in breast milk. To weigh the risks and benefits of breastfeeding, mothers should contact their doctors.

			Workers involved in making or processing PFAS and PFAS-containing materials are more likely to be exposed than the general population. Workers may be exposed to PFAS by inhaling them, getting them on their skin, and swallowing them, but inhaling them is the most likely route for exposure.
			<br><br>
			Studies have shown that only a small amount of PFAS can get into your body through your skin. Therefore, showering and bathing in water containing PFAS should not increase exposure. Washing dishes in water containing PFAS should not increase exposure.

			You can lower your exposure to PFAS in these ways:

		    If your drinking water is contaminated above levels specified by the EPA or your state government, use an alternate water source for drinking, preparing food, cooking, brushing teeth, and any other activity when you might swallow water. If you do not know if your water is contaminated, ask your local health department.
		    Avoid eating contaminated fish. Check with your local or state health and environmental quality departments for fish advisories in your area and follow the advisories.
		    Even though recent efforts to remove PFAS have reduced the likelihood of exposure, some products may still contain them.

		Weller Water has the best whole house PFAS removal system available in Michigan
		at Weller Water our goal is to help everyone in Michigan get Really, Really, Really Clean Water. 
		Our revolutionary new whole house reverse osmosis system will do just that for you. 
		It will Filter all your homes water, making in clean and safe to use for everyone in your family.

		Everyday there are more and more sites in Michigan where high PFAS, Arsenic, Iron, Nitrate, Nitrite, Iron and Lead levels have been found in the water. This is only going to get worse as more testing is being done. PFAS is a group of toxic chemicals that have been used for Fire Fighting at Airports and other types of fire proofing and heat resistant products.

		Once PFAS is exposed to the ground it starts to make its way into the ground water where it never goes away. It continues to contaminate the surface water while getting deeper and deeper until it makes it to the Aquifer where it then gets into homes through their wells. PFAS has been proven to create many heath issues including several types of cancer. Should you be bathing in a toxic chemical? Should you be cooking with Toxic Chemicals? If your water has toxic chemicals in it, skin contact is not recommended. Absorbing chemicals through your skin is just as bad as drinking them.

		If PFAS has been found in or near your area you will likely have it in your water. It may not show up right away but as the underground water aquifers are connected, it will most likely with time get to your well.  We offer the Best Whole House Reverse Osmosis system for nearly complete removal of the PFAS, Arsenic and Lead from your water.

		Our system will remove the toxic chemicals from your water bringing the levels down to nearly ZERO. There is NO other single product sold today that can come even close to the level of purity that our system produces. It gives you Really, Really, Really Clean Water!!

		Our system uses new innovative proprietary products that have been found through a 3rd party independent testing lab to have the best rejection rate of toxic chemicals in the industry. The system has a very small foot print so it does not take over your whole basement.   
		Our Team of Professionals are traveling to homes in Michigan testing water nearly every day, so please let us test yours.

			<span>What is Arsenic?</span>
			<br><br>
			Arsenic is a natural component of the earth’s crust and is widely distributed throughout the environment in the air, water and land. It is highly toxic in its inorganic form.

			People are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic through drinking contaminated water, using contaminated water in food preparation and irrigation of food crops, industrial processes, eating contaminated food and smoking tobacco.

			Long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic, mainly through drinking-water and food, can lead to chronic arsenic poisoning. Skin lesions and skin cancer are the most...<a href="Arsenic.html">Read more ></a>

			<span>How Lead Gets into Drinking Water?</span><br><br>
			Lead can enter drinking water when plumbing materials that contain lead corrode, especially where the water has high acidity or low mineral content that corrodes pipes and fixtures. The most common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. In homes with lead pipes that connect the home to the water main, also known as lead services lines, these pipes are typically the most significant source of lead in the water.  Lead pipes are more likely to be found in older cities and homes built before 1986.  Among homes... <a href="Lead.html">Read more ></a>

			<span>Hazards of Iron overload</span>
			<br><br>
			Earlier this year, Nutrition Action Health letter, published by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, summarized the latest evidence for the effects of excess iron stores.
			The problem with too much stored iron is that, short of bleeding, the body can’t easily get rid of it. Menstruating women are unlikely to have a problem, but for others with high stores the recommended treatments include phlebotomy and frequent blood donation. Without these measures, excess iron gets deposited in the liver, heart and pancreas, where it can cause cirrhosis, liver cancer...

			<span>How does Nitrate get into drinking water?</span>
			<br><br>
			Nitrate can occur naturally in surface and groundwater at a level that does not generally cause health problems. High levels of nitrate in well water often result from improper well construction, well location, overuse of chemical fertilizers, or improper disposal of human and animal waste. Sources of nitrate that can enter your well include fertilizers, septic systems, animal feedlots, industrial waste, and food processing waste.
