		Everyday there are more and more sites in Michigan where high Arsenic levels have been found in the water. This is only going to get worse as more testing is being done. The awareness of PFAS, Lead, Nitrite, Iron, Arsenic and Nitrate contamination has created a greater awareness of water quality here in Michigan. We want you to know how to remove Arsenic from your water.

		Once Arsenic is exposed to the ground it then starts to make its way into the ground water where it never goes away. It continues to contaminate the surface water while getting deeper and deeper until it makes it to the Aquifer where it then gets into homes through their wells. Arsenic has been proven to create many heath issues including several types of cancer.

		If Arsenic has been found in your area you will likely have it in your water. It may not show up right away but as the underground water aquifers are connected, it will most likely with time get to your well.  We offer the Best Whole House Reverse Osmosis system for nearly complete removal of the Arsenic from your water. Should you be bathing in a toxic chemical? Should you be cooking with Toxic Chemicals? If your water has toxic chemicals in it, skin contact is not recommended. Absorbing chemicals through your skin is just as bad as drinking them.

		What is Arsenic?
	</h4>

<div class="middleSection container is-fluid">
	<article class="midArticle customSection">

			Arsenic is an element that occurs naturally in rocks and soil and is used for a variety of purposes within industry and agriculture. It is also a byproduct of copper smelting, mining, and coal burning. Arsenic can combine with other elements to make chemicals used to preserve wood and to kill insects on cotton and other agricultural crops.
			Where and how does arsenic get into water?

			Arsenic can enter the water supply from natural deposits in the earth or from industrial and agricultural pollution. It is widely believed that naturally occurring arsenic dissolves out of certain rock formations when ground water levels drop significantly. Some industries in the United States release thousands of pounds of arsenic into the environment every year. Once released, arsenic remains in the environment for a long time. Arsenic is removed from the air by rain, snow, and gradual settling. Once on the ground or in surface water, arsenic can slowly enter ground water. High arsenic levels in private wells may come from certain arsenic containing fertilizers used in the past or industrial waste. It may also indicate improper well construction or overuse of chemical fertilizers or herbicides in the past.
			How can I find out whether there is arsenic in my water?

			If you suspect a problem and your water comes from your well, you may contact us and we would be happy to come out and give you a free water test.
